# Frailty Data Analysis Findings

## Summary Statistics for Numeric Variables

|               |   mean |   median |   std |
|:--------------|-------:|---------:|------:|
| Height        |  68.60 |    68.45 |  1.67 |
| Weight        | 131.90 |   136.00 | 14.23 |
| Height_m      |   1.74 |     1.74 |  0.04 |
| Weight_kg     |  59.83 |    61.69 |  6.46 |
| Age           |  32.50 |    29.50 | 12.86 |
| Grip strength |  26.00 |    27.00 |  4.52 |
| BMI           |  19.68 |    19.19 |  1.78 |

## Relationship between Grip Strength and Frailty

Correlation between Grip strength and Frailty_binary: -0.4759

The negative correlation indicates that **higher** grip strength is associated with **lower** frailty (Frailty_binary=0 means N).
This supports the hypothesis that reduced grip strength correlates with higher frailty scores.
